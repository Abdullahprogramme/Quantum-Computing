### About
This repositry contain codes of quantum computing, including topics like quantum tomography, qubits, simulations, operations performed and quantum gates. 
Many of them does not use QisKit which is the quantum library in python, but they are made to simulate them using normal code and features available in python.
Run the programs to understand better.

### Tools used
1. Python
2. QisKit
3. Vs Code
4. Cursor
5. MatplotLib

### To clone use these commands
